# neighborhoodmap
project 5 from udacity course.

I wanted to keep everything in a modular way. Which i had never done before. I had heard of require so i wanted to give it a go. Then i needed a way to couple view to module with knockout, which knockout-amd-helpers solve.


## uses

* require
* knockout-amd-helpers
* json
* async

## doesn't use

* jquery (just wanted to try without)

## tested in

* ie 11
* chrome
* firefox

## TO DO 

* better error handling
* try r.js
* use kockout components instead of amd-helper
* set focus on onclick return to search
